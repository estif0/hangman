# Hangman
- Hangman is a word game in which the player must guess a hidden word. The player guesses letters one by one and is told where they appear in the secret word. You have seven lives in this game. With each error, a life is lost. The goal is to find the secret word while avoiding losing all of your lives.

- It should be noted that entering a previously used letter or an invalid input does not result in the loss of lives.
